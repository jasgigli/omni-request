Below is a **summary of which advanced features your OmniRequest library currently has** (based on the code you’ve added) and **which additional features** might be the most impactful for solving real-world developer pain points going forward.

---

## 1. **Features Already in Your Library**

### A. Advanced Caching & Revalidation

- **ETag / Last-Modified Support**:  
  Via the `RevalidationCacheMiddleware`, you handle conditional requests (`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`) and can serve cached responses if the server replies `304 Not Modified`.

- **Cache Invalidation & Revalidation Hooks**:  
  Hooks like `onStore` and `onOffline` let developers customize how they handle storing or returning data from the cache.

- **Offline-First Mode**:  
  In a browser, data can be stored in IndexedDB for offline usage. This is especially helpful for unreliable networks or offline apps.

### B. Concurrency Control & Rate Limiting

- **Global or Endpoint-Level Concurrency Limits**:  
  The `ConcurrencyRateLimitMiddleware` allows a max number of in-flight requests globally or per endpoint.

- **Token Bucket Algorithm**:  
  Developers can specify a token bucket to smooth out bursts, automatically refilling tokens at a defined rate.

- **Queueing & Priority**:  
  If concurrency or tokens are unavailable, requests can queue. A `priorityFn` can reorder queued requests, letting critical requests jump ahead.

### C. Intelligent Retry & Circuit Breakers

- **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**:  
  The `IntelligentRetryMiddleware` calculates exponential backoff and can add random jitter to avoid “thundering herd” problems.

- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**:  
  After multiple consecutive failures, the circuit opens and fails fast. After a cooldown, it half-opens to test the endpoint again.

- **Granular Retry Conditions**:  
  Developers can define which errors or status codes trigger a retry (e.g., network errors or 5xx but not 4xx).

## 2. **Features You Might Add Next**

Below are some of the **most impactful** remaining features that can further differentiate your library and solve real-world developer challenges.

### A. **Custom Instrumentation & Tracing**

1. **OpenTelemetry or Custom Tracing Hooks**  
   - Let developers attach trace IDs, measure request latency, or integrate with logging/tracing systems.  
   - This helps large apps or microservices monitor performance and pinpoint slow endpoints.

2. **Performance Metrics**  
   - Provide built-in metrics (avg response time, request counts, error rates).  
   - Expose them via events or a built-in aggregator so devs can easily observe how the library is performing.

**Why It’s Important:**  
Modern production apps rely heavily on metrics and observability to ensure reliability, especially in microservice or distributed systems.

---

### B. **Extended Plugin / Middleware System**

1. **Dynamic Loading of Plugins**  
   - Let developers add or remove plugins at runtime (e.g., for logging, caching, authentication).  
2. **Middleware Composition**  
   - Let them reorder or selectively apply middleware on a per-request basis.  
3. **Chaining / Pipeline Patterns**  
   - Provide a more powerful system than typical interceptors, with before/after transformations and debugging tools.

**Why It’s Important:**  
Your library already uses a middleware approach, but adding more dynamic composition (e.g., apply a custom plugin only for certain routes) can address advanced use cases and keep the library flexible.

---

### C. **Automatic Auth & Token Refresh**

1. **Built-in OAuth2 / JWT**  
   - Standard flows for refreshing tokens automatically.  
2. **Multiple Auth Strategies**  
   - Basic, Bearer, or custom headers.  
3. **Credential Storage & Rotation**  
   - Securely store tokens, automatically rotate them upon expiration.

**Why It’s Important:**  
Many developers face the hassle of implementing token refresh logic repeatedly. Providing a robust built-in solution saves time and prevents errors.

---

### D. **Customizable Data Transformation**

1. **JSON -> Class Conversion**  
   - Integrate with TypeScript classes or schemas (like Zod/JOI) to auto-validate responses.  
2. **GraphQL or JSON:API Support**  
   - Provide specialized data transformations for these protocols, including error handling.  
3. **Bidirectional Serialization**  
   - Convert request payloads to `FormData` or JSON, parse responses into typed objects.

**Why It’s Important:**  
Many teams want a typed, validated approach for their request/response data, especially in TypeScript-based projects. This can reduce runtime errors and improve developer productivity.

---

### E. **File Upload & Progress Reporting**

1. **Multi-Part FormData**  
   - Built-in support for large file uploads, boundary management.  
2. **Progress Callbacks**  
   - In Node, use streams; in the browser, use `onUploadProgress`.  
   - Developers can show progress bars or handle partial uploads gracefully.

**Why It’s Important:**  
File uploads are common. Native `fetch` requires manual streaming, and `axios` has partial progress support, but not for Node streaming. Offering a robust solution helps dev teams building large upload flows.

---

### F. **Advanced Error Categorization & Handling**

1. **Error Categories**  
   - Distinguish network errors, timeouts, 4xx, 5xx, circuit-breaker rejections, etc.  
2. **Fallback Logic**  
   - If the primary endpoint fails, automatically try a secondary endpoint.  
3. **Localized / User-Friendly Messages**  
   - Let devs easily transform error objects into user-facing messages or logs.

**Why It’s Important:**  
Large apps need more nuance in error handling. Categorizing errors helps developers log, alert, or recover from them properly.

## 3. **Summary & Recommendations**

Your OmniRequest library already has **three major advanced features**:

1. **Advanced Caching & Revalidation**  
2. **Concurrency Control & Rate Limiting**  
3. **Intelligent Retry & Circuit Breakers**

This already puts you far ahead of `fetch` and `axios` in solving common performance and reliability challenges. To further address **real-world developer pain points**, consider adding:

- **Instrumentation & Tracing**: Observability is crucial in modern systems.  
- **Dynamic Plugin System**: More flexible composition of middleware.  
- **Automatic Auth**: Commonly needed in enterprise apps (OAuth2, JWT refresh).  
- **Data Transformation**: Simplifies typed, validated request/response handling.  
- **File Upload & Progress**: Another frequent pain point in real-world apps.  
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Offer fallback endpoints, typed error categories, user-friendly messages.

By focusing on these additional features, you’ll cover an even broader range of real-world scenarios, making OmniRequest a truly comprehensive, enterprise-grade HTTP client solution.
