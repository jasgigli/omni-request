Below is a consolidated list of features that the **Omni Request** library aims to incorporate. This list covers native approaches (XHR, Fetch, Axios) and adds advanced, modern capabilities to address common developer pain points:

### Native & Traditional Methods

- **XMLHttpRequest (XHR)**
  - Classic API available in all browsers.
  - Callback-based with verbose syntax.
  - Provides low-level control of HTTP requests.

- **Fetch API**
  - Native, promise-based API in modern browsers.
  - Supports async/await for cleaner asynchronous code.
  - Offers features like streaming responses and built-in cancellation via AbortController.

- **Axios**
  - A popular third-party library that wraps XHR (or fetch polyfills).
  - Provides built-in JSON transformation, interceptors, and error handling.
  - Supports both browser and Node.js environments.

### Advanced & Additional Features in Omni Request

- **Unified Configuration & Fluent Interface**
  - Consistent API across browser and Node.js.
  - Chainable methods for setting global and per-request options.

- **Request & Response Interceptors**
  - Pre-process requests (e.g., attach auth tokens).
  - Post-process responses (e.g., logging, error transformation).

- **Request Cancellation & Timeout**
  - Use of AbortController for automatic cancellation.
  - Custom timeout settings to abort long-running requests.

- **Automatic Retries with Exponential Backoff**
  - Automatic retry of failed requests based on network errors.
  - Configurable retry counts and exponential delay strategies.

- **Streaming Large Responses**
  - Support for processing large payloads via stream APIs.
  - Incremental data handling for file downloads or real-time feeds.

- **Advanced Caching & Logging**
  - Built-in caching strategies (e.g., in-memory caching).
  - Detailed logging of API calls to aid in debugging and monitoring.

- **Batching Requests**
  - Combine multiple API calls within a short time frame into a single request.
  - Reduces network overhead and improves performance.

- **Concurrency Control**
  - Limit the number of simultaneous API calls.
  - Queue and manage requests to avoid overloading resources.

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
  - Automatically stop API calls to an unstable endpoint when error rates are high.
  - Prevents cascading failures and gives time for recovery.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Throttle requests to avoid exceeding defined thresholds.
  - Protects both the client and the server from overloading.

- **Plugin Architecture**
  - Extensible middleware system to inject custom behaviors.
  - Allows developers to add custom logging, analytics, or security layers.

- **Real-Time Updates with WebSocket Fallback**
  - Seamlessly switch from HTTP polling to WebSocket for live data.
  - Ideal for applications that require real-time notifications or updates.

- **Enhanced Error Reporting**
  - Return rich error objects including context (timestamps, request IDs, retry counts).
  - Helps developers diagnose and resolve issues faster.

This list represents a comprehensive, next-generation approach to API handling by combining the best features of traditional methods with innovative enhancements that directly address modern development challenges.
