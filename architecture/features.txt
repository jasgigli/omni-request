## 1. Advanced Caching & Revalidation

- **ETag / Last-Modified Support:**  
  Automatically handle conditional requests (`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`) to revalidate cached responses without refetching.
- **Cache Invalidation & Revalidation Hooks:**  
  Provide hooks for developers to customize cache expiry, partial revalidation, or offline caching logic.
- **Offline-First Mode:**  
  Store responses in a local database (e.g., IndexedDB) and serve them offline.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` offers no built-in caching logic (beyond the browser’s default). `axios` doesn’t have advanced revalidation or offline caching out of the box.

---

## 2. Intelligent Retry & Circuit Breakers

- **Exponential Backoff with Jitter:**  
  Avoid “retry storms” by adding random jitter to backoff intervals.
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns:**  
  Temporarily stop requests to a failing endpoint after multiple errors, then try again after a cooldown.
- **Granular Retry Conditions:**  
  Let developers define custom logic (e.g., retry on network errors or 5xx, but not on 4xx).

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` has no built-in retry mechanism, and `axios` only has simple interceptors—no built-in circuit breaker or jitter.

---

## 3. Concurrency Control & Rate Limiting

- **Global or Endpoint-Level Concurrency Limits:**  
  Let developers cap how many requests are in-flight to a particular endpoint or globally at once.
- **Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket Algorithms:**  
  Smooth out bursts of requests, ensuring APIs are not overloaded.
- **Queueing & Priority:**  
  Requests can be queued if concurrency is reached, with higher-priority requests jumping the queue.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
Neither `fetch` nor `axios` natively handle concurrency limits or advanced rate-limiting strategies.

---

## 4. Custom Instrumentation & Tracing

- **OpenTelemetry or Custom Tracing Hooks:**  
  Expose hooks so developers can measure request latency, attach trace IDs, or integrate with logging/tracing systems.
- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Provide built-in metrics for average response times, request counts, error rates, etc.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` doesn’t offer instrumentation hooks. `axios` can be intercepted, but typically requires extra libraries for robust tracing.

---

## 5. Extended Plugin / Middleware System

- **Dynamic Loading of Plugins:**  
  Allow plugins (for logging, caching, authentication) to be added or removed at runtime.
- **Middleware Composition:**  
  Let developers reorder or selectively apply middleware on a per-request basis, e.g. for specialized endpoints.
- **Chaining / Pipeline Patterns:**  
  A more powerful system than typical interceptors, enabling before/after transformations with easy debugging.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` has no concept of middleware. `axios` interceptors are simpler and less flexible than a fully composable pipeline.

---

## 6. Automatic Auth & Token Refresh

- **Built-in OAuth2 / JWT Handling:**  
  Provide a standard flow for refreshing tokens when expired, optionally storing them securely.
- **Multiple Auth Strategies:**  
  Basic, Bearer, custom headers, or cookie-based.  
- **Credential Storage & Rotation:**  
  Securely store tokens (in memory or local storage) with automatic rotation upon expiration.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
Neither `fetch` nor `axios` has built-in token refresh or multi-strategy auth flows. They rely on manual interceptor code.

---

## 7. Configurable Data Transformation

- **Built-in JSON -> Class Conversion:**  
  Let developers define TypeScript classes or schemas for automatic parsing and validation.
- **GraphQL or JSON:API Support:**  
  Provide specialized data transformations for these protocols, including error handling.
- **Bidirectional Serialization:**  
  For example, automatically convert request payloads to `FormData` or JSON, then parse the response into typed objects.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` only offers raw methods like `response.json()`, and `axios` has simple transformRequest/transformResponse arrays, but lacks typed conversion or GraphQL/JSON:API convenience.

---

## 8. File Upload & Progress Reporting

- **Multi-Part FormData:**  
  Built-in support for easily creating multi-part requests (including boundary management) for large file uploads.
- **Progress Callbacks:**  
  Provide granular upload/download progress events in both Node.js and browsers (e.g., using streams in Node, `onUploadProgress` in the browser).

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` progress events require manual streaming in the browser. `axios` has some progress support, but Node streaming is more limited.

---

## 9. WebSocket / SSE Integration

- **Real-Time Transport:**  
  Provide a unified interface for WebSocket or Server-Sent Events connections, including reconnection logic.
- **Push-Based Middleware:**  
  Similar to HTTP middleware, let developers transform inbound/outbound messages.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` doesn’t handle real-time protocols. `axios` is purely HTTP-based. A library that merges real-time with standard HTTP can be quite powerful.

---

## 10. Advanced Error Categorization & Handling

- **Error Categories:**  
  Differentiate network errors, timeout errors, HTTP status errors, or application-level errors with typed classes.
- **Automatic Fallbacks:**  
  Let developers define fallback logic (e.g., if the first endpoint fails, try a second).
- **Localized / User-Friendly Messages:**  
  Optionally transform error objects into localized messages or structured logs.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` simply throws on network errors. `axios` lumps most errors into a single shape. Detailed typed errors can be very helpful in large apps.

---

## 11. Built-In Telemetry & Analytics Hooks

- **Request & Response Events:**  
  Fire events (or pass them to a callback) whenever a request starts, ends, fails, etc.
- **Metrics Dashboard (Optional):**  
  Potentially track usage stats in memory or integrate with a logging system to view request patterns.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` has no built-in analytics hooks. `axios` can do some logging via interceptors but lacks an official analytics solution.

---

## 12. Environment Auto-Detection & Polyfills

- **Seamless Browser/Node/Bun/Deno Detection:**  
  Already partially in OmniRequest, but you can add more robust detection logic or fallback polyfills (e.g., if `fetch` is unavailable).
- **Optional Polyfills for Legacy Browsers:**  
  Offer a “compat” build that includes polyfills for older environments.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` is built into modern browsers and Node 18+, but older environments need polyfills. `axios` is cross-platform but requires manual polyfills for some features.

---

## 13. Advanced Stream Support

- **Browser ReadableStream:**  
  Provide easy ways to consume large files or chunked data in the browser, possibly piping it to a user callback or a file writer.
- **Node Stream Integration:**  
  For large downloads, pipe data to a file system stream or process it in chunks.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
`fetch` supports streaming in the browser but requires manual handling. `axios` can handle streams in Node but is not as flexible.

---

## 14. Plugin for SSR & Serverless

- **SSR Caching & Reuse:**  
  Provide a plugin to store request results in memory for a single SSR pass, preventing duplicate fetches.
- **Serverless Performance Hooks:**  
  Auto-measure cold starts, log request times, or integrate with serverless logs.

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
This is specialized for SSR frameworks like Next.js or serverless deployments—`fetch`/`axios` don’t natively handle SSR caching or performance hooks.

---

## 15. Full Customization of Retry / Timeout per Request

- **Per-Request Timeouts & Retries:**  
  Let developers override global settings on a per-request basis (e.g., a longer timeout for large file uploads).
- **Timeout Strategies:**  
  Soft timeouts (warn but continue) vs. hard timeouts (cancel the request).

**Why It’s Advanced:**  
While `axios` does allow request-specific configs, more advanced strategies (like soft/hard timeouts or partial retry logic) are not typical.
